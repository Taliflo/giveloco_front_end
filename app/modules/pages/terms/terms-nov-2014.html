  <p>Law and Forum for Disputes – This Agreement shall be governed in all respects of the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

  <p>Arbitration Option – For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than C$15,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event that a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (<q>ADR</q>) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be sole based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>Improperly Filed Claims – All claims you bring against Taliflo must be resolved in accordance with this Resolution of Disputes section. All claims filed or brought contrary to the Resolution of Disputes section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to the Resolution of Disputes Section, Taliflo may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to C$1500, provided that Taliflo has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>

    <h2>25. No Waiver</h2>
    <p>No waiver by either you or Taliflo of any breach or default or failure to exercise any right allowed under these Terms and Conditions is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default or a waiver or forfeiture of any similar or future rights under this Agreement.</p>

    <h2>26. Headings</h2>
    <p>The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall be of no legal force or effect.</p>

    <h2>27. Severability</h2>
    <p>If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of these Terms and Conditions invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining portions of these Terms and Conditions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>28. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Taliflo will not be liable for any default or delay in the performance of its obligations under these Terms and Conditions due to acts of God, terrorism, natural disasters, earthquakes, fire, riots, floods, and other similar events, to the extent such event is beyond Taliflo's reasonable control.</p>

    <h2>29. Additional Disclosures</h2>

Through the Account, you will be presented with an application form (the <q>Application</q>) that you can complete if you wish to instruct Taliflo to submit an application on your behalf to a Processor. Your Application will be submitted to only one Processor, being the one indicated therein. The Application requires that you submit a considerable amount of information concerning your business, its shareholders, transaction amounts and other personal non-public information, as well as a graphic representation of your signature (collectively, the <q>Application Data</q>). Each Processor has its own format for an application for Merchant Services (the <q>Processor Application</q>). The data required by the Processor Application is equivalent to the Application Data. The Processor Application includes the actual merchant agreement (the <q>Merchant Agreement</q>) pursuant to which Merchant Services may be delivered to you if the Processor accepts your application. The Application has a link to the Processor Application; you should click that link and review the terms thereof before proceeding with an Application.</p>
