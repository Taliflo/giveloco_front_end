	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><i>Dated March 8, 2014</i></p>

	<p>Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information.</p>

	<h2>What Personal Information do we Collect?</h2>

	<p>In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. We collect only that information that we need in order to maintain a high level of customer service to you. Sometimes that is only a name and an email address, but in some circumstances, we need to have more information.</p>

	<h2>Protecting your Privacy</h2>

	<p>We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. Whenever you provide sensitive information (for example, a credit card number to make a purchase), we will take reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting your card number. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.</p> 

	<p>As mentioned above, we will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. We will need to provide your name and delivery address to a trusted shipping or fulfilment company if you have asked us to send something to you.</p>
